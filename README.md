# Automated-Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Python

Analyzing a data helps us to gather information about the data like how it is stored, what are the different attributes and their properties. Data Analysis can be performed using different python libraries like pandas, etc.

**DTale:**

DTale is a Flask and React-based powerful tool which is used to analyze and visualize pandas data structure seamlessly. It supports different objects like Data Frame, Series, etc. It works well on both the Jupyter notebook and the command-line interface.

DTale is a Graphical Interface where we can select the data we want to analyze and how to analyze using different graphs and plots.

D-Tale is a recently created library (end of February 2020) that allows us to visualize a Pandas DataFrame. It generates an interactive graphical interface in which we can define what we want the data to look like and do an exploratory analysis of data as we like.

**Sweetviz:**

Sweetviz is an open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with a single line of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application.

The system is built around quickly visualizing target values and comparing datasets. Its goal is to help quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks.

There are 3 main functions for creating reports:

analyze() compare() compare_intra()

Here I have used analyze() to create a html report
